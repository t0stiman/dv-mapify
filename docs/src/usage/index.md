# Using Maps

The Mapify mod doesn't do anything on it's own. To use it you need to download a custom map.

## Installing Maps

In general, it's best to follow the instructions in the description of the map mod. Here are some generic installation instructions as a fallback.

### Manual

Maps can be installed manually like any other mod in the Unity Mod Manager GUI. Download the maps .zip file and drag and drop it into Unity Mod Manager.

### Vortex

An alternative way to install maps is to use [Vortex][vortex] with the [Derail Valley Support Extension][vortex-dv].

To install a map from Nexus Mods using Vortex, click `Mod Manager Download` instead of `Manual Download` on the `Files` tab of the mod.
This will open Vortex, and prompt you to install the map.



## Changing Maps

When creating a **new** session in Career or Sandbox mode, you can select the map you want to play on just below the difficulty.
If a session has already been loaded, you cannot change the map.
